# hmpo-journey-tester
An ultra lightweight smoke tester for GDS based forms

This is an ultra lightweight smoke tester allowing you to run through multiple parts of your journey and validate that the end point was reached.

It assumes a number of defaults but can be overridden as required on a page/step basis. 

It is explicitly intended to be flexible - the same configuration should be run against multiple stages of deployment, e.g `integration`, `staging` and `production` without requiring any changes. This enables you to ensure that even with many microservices involved, that your key journey is still functional. Consider this your 100 000 feet view - anything more complicated than successfully reaching the end path should be considered for a more low level test. 

It is designed to target `hmpo-form-wizard` forms, but can be applied to similar GDS style pages.

# Config
A journey is a JSON file containing the following sections:

* `pages`
    - this is a keyed object with the key representing the path of a page
        - `fields` - this is a keyed object with selectors and values for those fields
            - `radiobuttons` & `checkboxes` ignore the value
            - `file inputs` use the value as a filename to upload, this is relative to the journey JSON file.
        - `navigate`
            - submit button or continuation link selector. If this is `false` the journey will wait to automatically navigate to the next page. This can also be an array of selectors to try in sequence until one is found.
        - `maxRetries`
            - The maximum number of times this path can be visited.
        - `waitFor`
            - specify how to wait for page navigation. Can be set to wait for a page `load`, to wait for network `idle`, or a delay in milliseconds. Defaults `load`.
        - `collect`
            - a keyed object mapping identifiers in the page to property values to be stored.
        - `navigationTimeout`
            - the maximum time in milliseconds to wait to progress to the next page. Defaults to 30 seconds.
        - `axe` - Axe configuration object
                        axe: {
            `run` - Run axe against this page (default: true)
            `options` - Axe run options
            `stopOnFail` - Stop journey if there are any axe errors (default: true)
            `simple` - Simplify axe output (default: true)
            `ignore` - Object of ids to ignore, with optional matching paterns
                `path` - Pattern to match offending url path
                `html` - Pattern to match offending html opening tag
                `summary` - Pattern to match description of error
                `target` - Pattern to match reported target element
* `staticPages`
    - array of static page paths to build a pages object
* `url`
    - a default hostname for the start and final paths. Defaults to `http://localhost`. Can be overridden with the `--url` command line option.
* `start`
    - the start path. Defaults to '/'
* `final`
    - the successful final path. Defaults to '/'
* `exitPaths`
    - if you have pages that are considered an error state, but are still on your site, define them here.
* `allowedHosts`
    - if you have any other hosts that are accessed as part of your journey (e.g. payment gateways)
* `defaults`
    - Any options you define here will apply to all `pages` unless overridden per page.
* `browser` - an object of puppeteer browser options.
    - `pupeteer` - set to true to use Puppeteer
    - `selenium` - set to true to use Selenium
    - `headless` - run Puppeteer in headless mode. Can be overridden with `--headless` and `--no-headless`
    - `slowMo` - run in slow mode. Can be overridden `--slomo 500`
    - `capabilities` - set object of Selenium capabilities
* `lastPagePause`
    - length of time in milliseconds to pause on the last page in non-headless mode
* `disableImages`
    - don't download images
* `disableCSS`
    - don't download css
* `disableAnalytics`
    - don't talk to google analytics collect endpoint
* `disableJavascript`
    - disable Javascript in the browser
* `axe`
    - Run Axe tests on journey - can be set with the `--axe` cli flag
